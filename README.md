# CS-300

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For the projects in this course, we were tasked with developing code for a system that displayed information from collected data using txt files being opened, data being collected, and data being stored in data structures such as Vectors, hash tables, and Binary Trees.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures are really important for development because they help us organize and store data in a way that works well for our specific program needs. Different data structures are good for different types of data and operations, and picking the right one can make a big difference in how well our program works. Understanding different data structures and how they work can help us choose the best one and make our program run more smoothly.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When encountering any roadblocks or problems I had when developing my code and other assignments in this course, I often times seeked help from peers or researched my question more online by reading questions and answers regarding specific coding questions or errors.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work I've done on this project and throughout this course has expanded my knowledge a ton. I now have a foundation for how a developer should design software before coding and during coding. With all the techniques I have learned in this course, I will continue to apply the methods learned in my future career and in my education.

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

As mentioned above, the work on this project has evolved the way I write programs. By learning how to design software and how to properly set up your environment for developing a sophisticated program, I have evovled the way I write and interpret tasks or problems as it pertains to development.
